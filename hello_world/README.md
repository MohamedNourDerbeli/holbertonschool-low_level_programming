   - **Usage:** Execute the script with the C file as an argument.

3. **`100-intel`**
   - **Description:** Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.
   - **Usage:** Execute the script with the C file as an argument.

4. **`101-quote.c`**
   - **Description:** Write a C program that prints a specific quote to the standard error.
   - **Usage:** Compile and run the program.

5. **`2-assembler`**

## How to Compile

To compile any of the C programs, you can use a C compiler like `gcc`. For example:

```bash
gcc -o program_name source_code.c
