## Projects

### functions_nested_loops

- Description: This project involves creating a function to print the 9 times table, starting with 0.

### hello_world

- Description: This project includes the main code and content of the "hello_world" application.

### makefiles

- Description: A project dedicated to demonstrating and practicing the use of makefiles in the development of C programs.

### more_functions_nested_loops

- Description: This project likely explores more complex functions and nested loops, possibly related to common coding interview questions such as the "Fizz-Buzz test."

### variables_if_else_while

- Description: A project that aims to develop a program capable of printing all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

## Usage

Each project directory contains its own set of source files and instructions. You can explore individual projects by navigating to their respective directories.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to Holberton School for providing these programming challenges and learning opportunities.
