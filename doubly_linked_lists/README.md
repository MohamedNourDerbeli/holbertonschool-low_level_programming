# Doubly Linked List Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of a doubly linked list in [programming language]. A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next and previous elements in the sequence.

## Features

- **Insertion**: Add elements at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the list.
- **Deletion**: Remove elements from the list.
- **Traversal**: Traverse the list in both forward and backward directions.
- **Search**: Find elements in the list.

## Usage

To use the doubly linked list in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohamedNourDerbeli/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/doubly_linked_lists
